# StrategyLens AI | Research Assistant Task

This repository contains my solution for the **Research Assistant - Product Ideation & Frontend Task**. It is a high-fidelity React application designed to help strategy consultants navigate information overload through AI-driven synthesis and scenario simulation.

## Problem Statement & Target Persona
Management consultants and strategy professionals often face "information paralysis" when reviewing documents that exceed 500 pages. My solution, **StrategyLens AI**, focuses on:
* **Target Users**: Strategy Consultants, Private Equity Associates, and Business Analysts.
* **Core Problem**: The inability to quickly extract actionable insights and simulate "what-if" scenarios from massive datasets.

## Feature Set (The Solution)
Following the task requirements, I have ideated and built the following pages:

1.  **Landing Page**: A high-conversion introduction explaining how the assistant reduces research time for consulting teams.
2.  **Dashboard**: A centralized hub displaying recent strategy projects, saved insights, and document upload history.
3.  **Main AI Page (The Simulator)**: A sophisticated chat interface designed for scenario testing and agentic strategy discussions.
4.  **Document Viewer**: A dual-pane interface optimized for summarizing 500–1000 page PDFs and highlighting critical financial risks.

## Technical Implementation
The project adheres to the following technical requirements:
* **React**: For a modular, component-based frontend architecture.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For a clean, "Management Consulting" aesthetic without external icon dependencies.
* **Framer Motion**: For smooth, professional page transitions and micro-interactions.
* **Mock Data**: The AI responses and document summaries are mocked to demonstrate the intended user flow.
